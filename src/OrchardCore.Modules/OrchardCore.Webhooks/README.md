# WebHooks (OrchardCore.WebHooks)

Webhooks provide a way for external services to receive information about certain events as soon as they happen in your Orchard site. They allow you to extend and integrate your site with other applications around the web.

When the specified events happen weâ€™ll send a POST request to each of the URLs you have configured. This allows external sites to be notified in near real-time when events such as a new blog post are published within your site.
